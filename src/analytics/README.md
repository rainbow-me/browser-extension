# `~/analytics`

Our Segment wrapper.

```typescript
import { analytics } from '~/analytics';

analytics.identify({
  ...userProperties,
});

analytics.track(analytics.event.applicationDidMount);
analytics.track(analytics.event.appStateChange, {
  category: 'app state',
  label: 'foo',
});

analytics.screen(Routes.SWAPS_PROMO_SHEET, {
  ...metadata,
});
```

## Events

Events are managed as const objects in `~/analytics/event` to reduce the possibility of developer
error and help us strictly type their payloads where we can. Event names should
adhere to a naming convention as much as possible. Roughly:

```bash
<name_or_category>.<action>
```

Here, `name_or_category` should be descriptive, can contain multiple `.` separated
parts, and increase in specificity from left to right. For instance, swaps
related events might start with `swaps`. But different features within swaps
might warrant bucketing into separate sub-categories, like:

```bash
swaps.user_form
swaps.backend_processing
```

Finally, the `action` should be the _past-tense_ action that occurred:

```bash
swaps.user_form.submitted
swaps.backend_processing.network_failed
```

### Adding a new event

Add to the `event` object in `~/analytics/event`. Use a camelCase value for the
key, and the event name (following the convention above) as the value.

```typescript
export const event = {
  swapsUserFormSubmitted: 'swaps.user_form.submitted',
};
```

You'll also need to define the payload for the event on the `EventProperties` type. If your event doesn't have a payload, use `undefined` as its value. See the file for examples.
